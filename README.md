# PRISM — Platform for Research Infrastructure Management

A request-tracking and operator-workflow system for MIT-WPU's
Department of Research & Development. One Python process, one
SQLite database, browser-based interface.

This file is the single authoritative reference for the project.
A competent developer reading only this file must be able to
reconstruct a functionally identical system.

---

## 1. Philosophy

**The Request Card.**  Every sample request is a card.  The card is
created when a requester submits a job and accumulates all data over
its lifetime: approvals, notes, files, operator actions, timestamps,
results.  Nothing is stored separately — the card is the single source
of truth for that job.

**Sliced visibility.**  The same cards form a single queue.  Every
page on the site is a filtered, role-appropriate slice of that queue.
The Queue page is the canonical view; the Home dashboard, Instrument
detail, Calendar, and Statistics pages are derived views.  There is no
data duplication between pages.

**Blobs within blobs.**  Every visual element on a page is a panel
(blob).  Panels contain sub-panels.  Each panel has a role-visibility
attribute: if the user's role is not in the panel's allowed set, the
panel is not rendered.  This applies uniformly to every element — page
sections, card fields, action buttons, navigation items.  There are no
exposed hyperlinks; navigation is through buttons and panel actions.

**LAN-first.**  This is a lightweight internal tool.  It runs on a
single machine on the local network.  There is no cloud dependency, no
external authentication provider, no CDN.  The design favours
simplicity and maintainability.

---

## 2. Technology

| Component   | Choice                                  |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Language    | Python 3.10+                            |
| Framework   | Flask (single file: `app.py`)           |
| Database    | SQLite (`lab_scheduler.db`, git-ignored) |
| Templates   | Jinja2                                  |
| Styles      | Single CSS file (`static/styles.css`)   |
| JavaScript  | Vanilla JS, FullCalendar for calendar   |
| Server      | Flask dev server, port 5055             |

No external Python packages beyond Flask and its dependencies.
No build step.  No bundler.  No transpiler.

---

## 3. User Roles

Roles are hierarchical.  A higher role inherits all capabilities of
lower roles unless otherwise noted.

| Role                | Scope         | Purpose                                |
|---------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| `requester`         | Own cards     | Submit requests, track own jobs        |
| `finance_admin`     | Finance steps | Approve/reject finance approval steps  |
| `professor_approver`| All cards     | Approve/reject faculty approval steps  |
| `faculty_in_charge` | Assigned instruments | Faculty oversight of specific instruments |
| `operator`          | Assigned instruments | Run instruments, receive samples, complete jobs |
| `instrument_admin`  | Assigned instruments | Manage instrument settings, operators, approval chains |
| `site_admin`        | All           | Full operational access, no user management |
| `super_admin`       | All           | Full access including user management  |

Owner status is determined by email match against the `OWNER_EMAILS`
environment variable, not by role.  Owners bypass all restrictions.

### Visibility Matrix

Every UI element checks the user's role before rendering.  The
`card_policy` object (computed per request, per user) contains two
sets:

- `card_policy.fields` — which data fields are visible (instrument,
  requester identity, operator identity, remarks, results, events,
  conversation, submitted documents, finance details).

- `card_policy.actions` — which action buttons are shown (approve,
  reject, mark submitted, mark received, schedule, complete, reassign,
  upload, reply, flag issue, update status).

The `user_access_profile()` function returns a dict of boolean
capabilities used by templates to show/hide navigation items, page
sections, and dashboard widgets.

---

## 4. Request Lifecycle

A card moves through these statuses in order.  Each transition is
logged in the immutable audit trail.

```
submitted
  │  (instrument accepting → auto-create approval chain)
  ▼
under_review
  │  Finance approves → Professor approves → Operator approves
  │  (any rejection → rejected)
  ▼
awaiting_sample_submission
  │  Requester marks physical sample delivered
  ▼
sample_submitted
  │  Operator confirms receipt
  ▼
sample_received
  │  Operator assigns schedule time
  ▼
scheduled
  │  Operator starts work
  ▼
in_progress
  │  Operator completes with results
  ▼
completed  (record locked)

rejected   (terminal — any approval step rejection)
```

### Approval Chain

Default sequence: Finance → Professor → Operator.  Configurable per
instrument via `instrument_approval_config`.  Steps execute in strict
order.  A step cannot be actioned until all prior steps are approved.

```

---

## 8. File Upload System

Each request gets a folder:
`uploads/users/<user_id>/requests/req_<id>_<request_no>/attachments/`

Allowed extensions: pdf, png, jpg, jpeg, xlsx, csv, txt.
Maximum upload: 100 MB.
Files are served through Flask, not as direct static files.

A sample slip PDF is auto-generated on request creation and stored as
`attachment_type=sample_slip`.

A `request_metadata.json` snapshot is written to the request folder
after every meaningful state change.  It contains the complete card
state and serves as an offline backup.

---

## 9. Communication

Four note types on each card:

| Type             | Author          | Visible to     |
|------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| `requester_note` | Requester       | Lab staff      |
| `lab_reply`      | Lab staff       | Requester      |
| `operator_note`  | Operator/admin  | Lab staff only |
| `final_note`     | Operator/admin  | Requester      |

Issue tracking: flag → respond → resolve cycle, tracked in
`request_issues`.

---

## 10. Security

### Current state

- Session-based authentication, 12-hour lifetime, HttpOnly cookies.
- Passwords hashed with pbkdf2:sha256.
- All SQL uses parameterized queries.
- File uploads validated against extension whitelist.
- Immutable audit log with SHA-256 hash chain.
- Role checks on every route via `login_required` and
  `role_required` decorators.
- Field-level and action-level visibility via `card_policy`.
- Client-side `data-vis` attribute system for visual role gating
  (convenience layer — not a security boundary).
- **CSRF protection** via Flask-WTF `CSRFProtect` on all POST routes.
- **Security headers**: CSP, X-Frame-Options DENY, nosniff,
  Referrer-Policy, HSTS (conditional on HTTPS mode).
- **Tag/scope authorization tables**: `access_tags`,
  `user_access_tags`, `instrument_access_tags` for flexible
  role + scope access control.
- **HTTPS-ready cookie config**: `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` toggled
  by `LAB_SCHEDULER_COOKIE_SECURE` environment variable.
- See `SECURITY_TODO.md` for full deployment checklist.

### Architecture: two-layer authorization

**Layer 1 — Server-side (mandatory, enforces security).**
Every route in `app.py` checks the session user against `ROLE_ACCESS_PRESETS`
and `request_card_policy()`.  The server never renders or returns data the
user is not authorised to see.  Jinja `{% if %}` blocks gate template
sections.  This layer is the security boundary.

**Layer 2 — Client-side `data-vis` (visual uniformity, not security).**
Every HTML element carries a `data-vis="role1 role2 ..."` attribute that
declares which roles may see it.  A JS engine on page load hides elements
whose roles do not match.  This gives uniform visual structure (the
"blobs-within-blobs" philosophy).  It is never trusted as a security
mechanism — a user who inspects the DOM will only find data the server
already authorised them to have.

## 11. Git and Development

> **AI agents: update this section if you change repo settings.**

| Setting          | Value                                           |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| VCS              | Git — open source, no proprietary services      |
| Working repo     | `Main/`                                         |
| Local remote     | `../lab-scheduler.git` (bare repo)              |
| Default branch   | `master`                                        |
| Git user.name    | AAAA                                            |
| Git user.email   | general.goje@gmail.com                          |

Push after every commit: `git push origin master`.
Commit messages: imperative mood, ≤ 72 chars first line.
Append `Co-Authored-By:` line.
Never force-push.

To run: `cd Main/ && pip install flask && python app.py`
(starts on `http://127.0.0.1:5055`).

Debug mode: controlled at the bottom of `app.py`.  Set `True` while
developing, `False` before committing.

Editor: VS Code.  No linter enforced.

To add a cloud remote later:
`git remote add github https://github.com/<user>/lab-scheduler.git`

**Result:** Populated instrument short_names. Queue shows date-only, short instrument names,
last 2 files, "Quick Action" header. Instruments table: full-size font (1rem), separate
Operators/Faculty/Links columns restored (Queue/Calendar/History). Instrument detail:
2-col layout (Machine+Summary left, Queue+Control right), summary stats hyperlinked to
filtered views, control panel below queue in right column. Request detail: always-visible
back button. Accent color darkened (#3b6d99) for better contrast. Calendar: global
shutdown creates downtime on all instruments. Short names flow through stats stream.
**Files:** app.py, static/styles.css, templates/schedule.html, templates/instruments.html,
templates/instrument_detail.html, templates/request_detail.html, templates/calendar.html

### 2026-04-08 | Claude Opus 4.6 (Claude Code) | Status: COMPLETED
**Intent:** Full site cleanup, visual consistency, calendar upgrade, layout restructure.
**Result:** Major cleanup pass:
- Calendar: drag-drop reschedule, click-to-create downtime, resize events, hover tooltips,
  instrument color-coding, card overlay with reschedule/notes, 6 new AJAX endpoints.
- Instrument detail: 3-tile layout (Machine|Summary|Control Panel) + Queue + Events.
  Big status button, navigation buttons (Queue/Calendar/Stats) in Machine tile.
  Back button in margin. All metadata fields editable (capabilities, description, links).
- Instruments page: reverted to clean table with category flair tags, alternating rows.
- Home page: instrument cards in 3-col grid (no carousel), uniform height, sorted by activity.
- Queue/Calendar: unified stream-pill controls, uniform page-title-bar everywhere.
- Bounded pane fix: unified `[data-pane-item]` selector, added to schedule rows.
  `overflow: visible`, no scrollbars anywhere, pagination only.
- Removed ~200 lines dead CSS (carousel, role-toggle, old layout classes).
- CSS: all inline styles moved to classes, datetime-local split to date+time.
- All pages render without errors across all 4 tested roles.
**Files:** app.py, static/styles.css, templates/ (all major templates rewritten)

### 2026-04-07 | Claude Opus 4.6 (Claude Code) | Status: COMPLETED
**Intent:** Centralized stats stream, instrument performance panels, CSS fixes.
**Result:** Built `facility_stats_stream()` — a per-request cached function that
computes all facility-wide and per-instrument metrics in 2 SQL queries. All pages
read from this stream (stats page, instrument detail, dashboard). Never recomputes
within a request. Added Performance and Live Status panels to instrument detail
sidebar. Stats page now reads live data from stream instead of separate query.
Consolidated 3 conflicting CSS definitions for queue action buttons into one
clean set (select + button sit inline, same height).
**Files:** app.py, templates/instrument_detail.html, static/styles.css

### 2026-04-07 | Claude Opus 4.6 (Claude Code) | Status: COMPLETED
**Intent:** Stats page redesign, assign button fix, Xcode wrapper, safety guardrails.
**Result:** Rewrote stats page with Apple-inspired design (new CSS class system,
Chart.js with Apple palette). Fixed assign/action buttons jumping to wrong
page (removed bucket_override="all" from redirect_to_queue). Fixed quick-receive
items disappearing (now shows "Received" state). Added safe_int/safe_float
helpers and input length limits to prevent overflow crashes. Added error
handlers for ValueError/OverflowError. Created Xcode macOS app project
(SwiftUI + WKWebView wrapper that auto-launches Flask). Fixed data-vis tags.
**Files:** app.py, templates/stats.html, templates/dashboard.html,
templates/user_detail.html, static/styles.css,
LabScheduler/ (new Xcode project)

### 2026-04-07 | Claude Opus 4.6 (Claude Code) | Status: COMPLETED
**Intent:** Security hardening, HTTPS preparation, bug fixes from prior session.
**Result:** Fixed 4 crashing bugs (stats query, Row serialization, macro kwarg).
Added CSRF protection (flask-wtf). Added security headers (CSP, HSTS-ready,
X-Frame-Options, nosniff). Added tag/flair scope tables (access_tags,
user_access_tags, instrument_access_tags) for flexible role+scope authorization.
Cookie config made HTTPS-switchable via env var. Created SECURITY_TODO.md
with full deployment checklist.
**Files:** app.py, templates/base.html, templates/dashboard.html,
templates/user_detail.html, SECURITY_TODO.md

### 2026-04-07 | Claude Opus 4.6 (Cowork) | Status: STARTED
**Intent:** Rewrite PROJECT.md to formal standard. Fix visual layout
issues (request detail blank space, queue row sizing, panel consistency).
Address user feedback on scroll panels and text cutoff.
**Result:** (to be updated after commit)
**Files:** PROJECT.md, static/styles.css, templates/request_detail.html

### 2026-04-07 | Claude Opus 4.6 (Cowork) | Status: COMPLETED
**Intent:** Set up local bare repo as open-source remote origin
**Result:** Created `lab-scheduler.git` bare repo. Updated PROJECT.md.
**Files:** PROJECT.md
**Git commit:** fa8bfcf

### 2026-04-07 | Claude Opus 4.6 (Cowork) | Status: COMPLETED
**Intent:** Consolidate all history views into single Queue page
**Result:** Replaced user_history, instrument_history, processed_history
routes with redirects to /schedule. Deleted 3 legacy templates. −910 lines.
**Files:** app.py, templates/ (deleted history.html, instrument_history.html,
processed_history.html), user_detail.html
**Git commit:** e503a2d

### 2026-04-07 | Claude Opus 4.6 (Cowork) | Status: COMPLETED
**Intent:** Fix two crashing bugs (missing table, missing macro import)
**Result:** Replaced query against nonexistent `request_events` table with
`audit_logs`. Added missing macro import in `instrument_detail.html`.
**Files:** app.py, templates/instrument_detail.html
**Git commit:** 401cefa

## 14. ROADMAP — Prioritised Feature Plan

> Philosophy: single global queue, event-driven audit, role-scoped views,
> `EntityManager` for all entities, `bounded_pane` pagination, `data-vis`
> gating, `StreamQuery` / `request_stream()` for all data queries.
> Every new feature reuses these patterns.

    GIT-VERIFIED WAVES (only code confirmed in git counts):
      Wave A — StreamQuery classes + factories + 3 call sites      [68196cb]
      Wave B — data-vis 100% across 24+ templates                  [43d9b97]
      Wave C — rate_limit + cancelled status + notification badge  [e3345b9]
      Wave D — cancel route + result confirm + email queue + pills [b7b122d]
      Wave E — instrument config + chain CRUD + email wiring       [3f5e8ea]
      Wave F — operator workload + utilization + turnaround + audit [d821b2b]

    VERIFIED:
      app.py syntax: OK (6575 lines, py_compile clean)
      CSS braces: balanced (552/552)
      Jinja blocks: all balanced (smart parser confirmed)
      Flask not available in sandbox — needs on-device test

    NEXT: Wave G — Phase 3 remaining (maintenance cal, sparklines, bulk actions)

### Execution Model

    Phase  →  Wave  →  Module  (each module ≈ 20 min)

Modules within a **wave** run in **parallel** (separate agents,
separate files). A wave finishes when all its agents report back.
The next wave starts only after the previous wave merges clean.

Key constraint: `app.py` is a single 7600-line file — only ONE
agent may edit it per wave. Template files are separate so multiple
template agents can run concurrently.

### Size Legend

- **S** = small, < 50 lines changed, < 20 min (1 module)
- **M** = medium, 50-200 lines, 20-40 min (1-2 modules)
- **L** = large, 200+ lines or external dependencies, 40-60 min (2-3 modules)

## Phase 1 — Architecture Foundation

*Every file brought to a uniform standard. No feature work until
Phase 1 is green.*

from scratch. Only Waves A-F above are confirmed in git.

---

## Phase 2 — Core Features + Phase 3 — Polish

*Phases 2 and 3 are interleaved by wave. Features are grouped by
file-conflict zones, not by phase number. The constraint is that
`app.py` is a single file — only ONE agent edits it per wave.
Templates are separate files and can parallelize freely.*

### Conflict Map (what touches what)

    Feature                 app.py section        Template
    ─────────────────────── ───────────────────── ─────────────────────
    Request Cancellation    new route ~L5800      request_detail.html
    Result Confirmation     new route ~L5850      request_detail.html
    Approval Visualization  new query ~L3600      request_detail.html
    Notification Badge      base template ctx     base.html
    Rate Limiting           decorator ~L200       (none — app.py only)
    Email Notifications     new module ~L7600     new email_prefs.html
    Form Control Panel      new routes ~L4900     new instrument_config.html
    Phase 3 audits          read-only             read-only
    Phase 3 features        various               various

    Bottleneck: request_detail.html (3 features touch it → serialize)
    Safe: features touching only new templates can run alongside anything

### Wave E (3 agents — crawl gate overlaps with safe Phase 2 work)

Phase 1 gate + two Phase 2 features that touch only app.py (no
template conflicts). The crawl is read-only so it can't conflict.

| Agent | Module | File(s) | Task | Status |
|-------|--------|---------|------|--------|
| E1 | 1.4.1 | all (read-only) | Crawl found: 282 Jinja mismatches, 24 undefined vars, CSS balanced, syntax OK | Done |
| E2 | 2.5.1 | app.py | `@rate_limit` decorator + applied to 3 POST routes (10/20/15 per 5min) | Done |
| E3 | 2.4.1+2.4.2 | app.py + base.html + styles.css | Notification badge: role-scoped count + nav badge + 60s JS poll | Done |

### Wave F (3 agents)

Depends on: E merged. Fix crawl issues + first request_detail feature + email backend.

| Agent | Module | File(s) | Task | Status |
|-------|--------|---------|------|--------|
| F1 | 1.4.2 | varies | (Merged into Phase 1 gate cleanup) | Done |
| F2 | 2.1.1+2.1.2 | app.py + request_detail.html | Request cancellation: full feature (backend + UI) | Done |
| F3 | 2.7.1 | app.py (~L7600) + new template | Email notifications: queue table, config, sender function | Done |

### Wave G (3 agents)

Depends on: F merged. Second request_detail feature + notification UI + email wiring.
F2 freed request_detail.html. F3 freed email section of app.py.

| Agent | Module | File(s) | Task | Status |
|-------|--------|---------|------|--------|
| G1 | 2.2.1+2.2.2 | app.py + request_detail.html | Result confirmation: full feature (backend + UI) | Done |
| G2 | 2.4.2 | base.html | Notification badge UI: auto-refresh JS poll | Done |
| G3 | 2.7.2+2.7.3 | app.py (email section) + new template | Email wiring into transitions + preferences page | Done |

### Wave H (3 agents)

Depends on: G merged. Third request_detail feature + form control panel + Phase 3 audits.
G1 freed request_detail.html. Audits are read-only.

| Agent | Module | File(s) | Task | Status |
|-------|--------|---------|------|--------|
| H1 | 2.3.1+2.3.2 | app.py + request_detail.html | Approval visualization: query + pill strip UI | Done |
| H2 | 2.6.1+2.6.2+2.6.3 | app.py + new instrument_config.html | Form control panel: config CRUD + UI + chain editor | Done |
| H3 | 3.1.1+3.1.2+3.1.3 | all (read-only) | Phase 3 audits: metadata + calendar + per-role page | Done |

### Wave I (3 agents — all Phase 3 features, independent)

Depends on: H merged. All touch different files.

| Agent | Module | File(s) | Task | Status |
|-------|--------|---------|------|--------|
| I1 | 3.2.1 | app.py + calendar.html | Maintenance calendar: downtime types, FullCalendar colors | Done |
| I2 | 3.2.2 | app.py + new_request.html | Request duplication: "Submit similar" button | Done |
| I3 | 3.3.3 | styles.css | Print-friendly CSS: `@media print` rules | Done |

### Wave J (3 agents)

| Agent | Module | File(s) | Task | Status |
|-------|--------|---------|------|--------|
| J1 | 3.3.1 | instrument_detail.html + app.py | Instrument sparkline: Chart.js 30-day trend | Done |
| J2 | 3.3.2 | app.py (export section) | Audit log export: CSV/JSON download | Done |
| J3 | 3.2.3 | app.py + schedule.html | Downtime impact report | In Progress |

### Wave K (3 agents)

| Agent | Module | File(s) | Task | Status |
|-------|--------|---------|------|--------|
| K1 | 3.2.4 | app.py + schedule.html | Bulk actions on queue: checkbox + action bar | Pending |

### Architecture Patterns (for new features)

Every new feature should use:

1. **`StreamQuery`** / **`request_stream()`** — canonical query builder, never raw SQL assembly
2. **`EntityManager`** — declare a manager, get CRUD+audit for free
3. **`as_dicts()`** — convert query results for templates
4. **`request_scope_sql()`** — filter by role, never raw role checks
5. **`bounded_pane`** — paginate any list longer than 10 items
6. **`data-vis`** — tag every visible element with allowed roles
7. **`log_action()`** — audit every state change, no exceptions
8. **`facility_stats_stream()`** — aggregate counters, cached per HTTP request
